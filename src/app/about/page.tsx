                        Hi, I'm Hitesh ðŸ‘‹ â€” a curious mind who enjoys turning complex problems into simple, practical solutions with the help of AI, data, and code. Right now, I'm pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science (AI & ML) at Chandigarh University, where I've been diving deep into machine learning, NLP, and computer vision.

                        Beyond the academics, I've built projects like an AI-powered remote proctoring system, a multi-agent RAG tool, and advanced lane detection for autonomous driving. I also love contributing to open-source and collaborating on ideas that push tech forward.

                        When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me exploring new tech trends, sketching out project ideas, or reading about how AI is shaping the world.

                        I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems, and I'm particularly interested in how AI can be used to create more efficient, accessible, and sustainable solutions. Whether it's through my projects, research, or collaborations, I'm always looking for ways to contribute to this exciting field.
