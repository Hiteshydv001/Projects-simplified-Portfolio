        title: 'The Smart Pillow - Non-Intrusive Health & Sleep Monitoring',
        status: 'Patent Application Filed',
        overview: `As a co-inventor, I conceptualized and filed a patent for the "Smart Pillow," an innovative health-tech device designed to monitor vital signs and sleep quality in a completely non-intrusive way. This project addresses the critical shortcomings of wearable health trackers, which are often uncomfortable and impractical for 24/7 monitoring, especially during sleep. Our invention embeds advanced biomedical sensors directly into a comfortable, ergonomic pillow, creating a seamless and passive health monitoring experience.`,
